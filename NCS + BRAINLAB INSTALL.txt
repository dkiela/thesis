# apt-get installed mpicxx in /usr/bin, so in the Makefile we set:
#
#	ifeq ($(SYSTEM),local)
#	   MPI = /usr
#	  NAME = ncs5pe
#	endif
#

# Also, make sure the following is set:
# 	SYSTEM = local

# If on AMD64 system, remove/adjust CFLAGS

make
cd ~/brainlab

# Add the following:
# 	remoteexec=False
# 	mcmd='/usr/bin/mpirun'

# Install dependencies for Brainlab
#sudo apt-get install python-scipy python-pyx python-setuptools python-wxversion libpng-dev libfreetype6-dev
# OR:

sudo apt-get build-dep python-matplotlib python-scipy python-scipy
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-scipy python-opengl python-pyx

# N.B. The following does not seem to be necessary anymore:
# Easy_install matplotlib to ensure compatability.
# Note that the normal command:
#	sudo easy_install -U matplotlib
# Doesn't work because of dependency issues.
# Instead, run:
#sudo easy_install http://location/of/latest/matplotlib.tar.gz
#sudo easy_install -U numpy
#sudo easy_install -U scipy
# (not sure if this is necessary)

# Run the testsuite
python testsuite.py
# if you get any errors, fix them.

# before you can do "import brainlab" and "import brain", you need to add the brainlab folder to your path in every simulation, in my case:
# 	import sys
# 	sys.path.append('/home/virtus/brainlab')
# alternatively, you can run your script directly from that folder

# Now make sure MPD is running
touch ~/.mpd.conf
chmod 600 ~/.mpd.conf
echo "MPD_SECRETWORD=blabla" > ~/.mpd.conf
mpd &

# Verify that the host is set properly
mpdtrace
# (the hostname that this outputs should be put into:
# /usr/lib/mpich/share/machines.LINUX)

# Verify that it executes commands
mpiexec -n 1 /bin/hostname
# (this should print your hostname)

# Now, we need to edit ~/brainlab/brainlab.py to fix the command execution
# change the appropriate line where the command is executed to this:
#
#    machfile="/usr/lib/mpich/share/machines.LINUX"
#
#    ncmd="cd "+tmpdir+"; "+mcmd+" -machinefile "+machfile+" "+nlcl+\
#    " -np "+`nprocs`+" "+ncscmd+" "+\
#    brainname+".in -d ./"   # end quote after I/O redir
#
# Also, set the appriate values at the top, if necessary

# Then, all you need is IPSC.txt and ESPC.txt and put them in your
# home directory.

# It is possible that you get a segmentation fault when making reports. This is due to
# linker/dependency inconsistencies. The segfault is caused by:
# __cxa_allocate_exception from libstdc++.so.6
# The solution is as follows (in .bashrc or before executing the command):
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6
