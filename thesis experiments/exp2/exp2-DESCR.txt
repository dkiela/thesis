In this series of experiments, I looked at two neurons X and Y, where X is continuously stimulated and we look at the correlation between the spike trains produced by X and Y.

At first, I did a trial where the ESYN value varies between 0.0 and 1.0, with 100 trials. This let to a prediction that correlation is highest between 0.01 and 0.05 so another experiment was performed, now looking at a more fine-grained picture, with 500 trials and ESYN values between 0.0 and 0.5.

In order to exclude the possibility that setting the ISYN value has an impact on NCS performance, an experiment with 20 trial runs was used, once with ISYN=0 and once with ISYN=1. The plots show this had no effect.
