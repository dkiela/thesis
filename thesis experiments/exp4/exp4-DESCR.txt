In these experiments, the excitatory conductance value was fixed and trials were run with a varying ISYN (100 trials, between 0.0 and 1.0) and either with
learning on (stimulating X for 2 seconds and Y for 1 second out of 2) or learning off (only stimulating X for 2 seconds).

The chosen ESYN values were: 0.08 and 0.058, because these showed the most promise.

0.08 was used with ENDSIM=2 and in the learning case ENDSIM/2
0.058 was used with ENDSIM=5 and learning ENDSIM/2=2 (no float)

Furthermore, 0.058 was repeated, but with identical firing rates (20,20 as opposed to 20,30) in the two stimuli

An experiment like exp3 should be repeated for the learning case, this will be done later, and perhaps only on a more "full-fledged" network.
