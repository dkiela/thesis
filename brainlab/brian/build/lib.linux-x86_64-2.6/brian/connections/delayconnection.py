class DelayConnection(Connection):
    '''
    Connection which implements heterogeneous postsynaptic delays
    
    Initialised as for a :class:`Connection`, but with the additional
    keyword:
    
    ``max_delay``
        Specifies the maximum delay time for any
        neuron. Note, the smaller you make this the less memory will be
        used.
    
    Overrides the following attribute of :class:`Connection`:
    
    .. attribute:: delay
    
        A matrix of delays. This array can be changed during a run,
        but at no point should it be greater than ``max_delay``.
    
    In addition, the methods ``connect``, ``connect_random``, ``connect_full``,
    and ``connect_one_to_one`` have a new keyword ``delay=...`` for setting the
    initial values of the delays, where ``delay`` can be one of:

    * A float, all delays will be set to this value
    * A pair (min, max), delays will be uniform between these two
      values.
    * A function of no arguments, will be called for each nonzero
      entry in the weight matrix.
    * A function of two argument ``(i,j)`` will be called for each
      nonzero entry in the weight matrix.
    * A matrix of an appropriate type (e.g. ndarray or lil_matrix).

    Finally, there is a method:
    
    ``set_delays(source, target, delay)``
        Where ``delay`` must be of one of the types above.
    
    **Notes**
    
    This class implements post-synaptic delays. This means that the spike is
    propagated immediately from the presynaptic neuron with the synaptic
    weight at the time of the spike, but arrives at the postsynaptic neuron
    with the given delay. At the moment, Brian only provides support for
    presynaptic delays if they are homogeneous, using the ``delay`` keyword
    of a standard ``Connection``.
    
    **Implementation**
    
    :class:`DelayConnection` stores an array of size ``(n,m)`` where
    ``n`` is ``max_delay/dt`` for ``dt`` of the target :class:`NeuronGroup`'s clock,
    and ``m`` is the number of neurons in the target. This array can potentially
    be quite large. Each row in this array represents the array that should be
    added to the target state variable at some particular future time. Which
    row corresponds to which time is tracked using a circular indexing scheme.
    
    When a spike from neuron ``i`` in the source is encountered, the delay time
    of neuron ``i`` is looked up, the row corresponding to the current time
    plus that delay time is found using the circular indexing scheme, and then
    the spike is propagated to that row as for a standard connection (although
    this won't be propagated to the target until a later time).
    
    **Warning**
    
    If you are using a dynamic connection matrix, it is your responsibility to
    ensure that the nonzero entries of the weight matrix and the delay matrix
    exactly coincide. This is not an issue for sparse or dense matrices.
