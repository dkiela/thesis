class TimedArray(numpy.ndarray):
    '''
    An array where each value has an associated time.
    
    Initialisation arguments:
    
    ``arr``
        The values of the array. The first index is the time index. Any
        array shape works in principle, but only 1D/2D arrays are
        supported (other shapes may work, but may not). The idea is to,
        have the shapes (T,) or (T, N) for T the number of time steps and
        N the number of neurons.
    ``times``
        A 1D array of times whose length should be the same as the first
        dimension of ``arr``. Usually it is preferable to specify a
        clock rather than an array of times, but this doesn't work in
        the case where the time intervals are not fixed.
    ``clock``
        Specify the times corresponding to array values by a clock. The
        ``t`` attribute of the clock is the time of the first value
        in the array, and the time interval is the ``dt`` attribute of
        the clock. If neither ``times`` nor ``clock`` is specified, a
        clock will be guessed in the usual way (see :class:`Clock`).
    ``start, dt``
        Rather than specifying a clock, you can specify the start time
        and time interval explicitly. Technically, this is useful
        because it doesn't create a :class:`Clock` object which can
        lead to ambiguity about which clock is the default. If dt is
        specified and start is not, start is assumed to be 0.
        
    Note that if the clock, or start time and dt, of the array should be the
    default clock values, then you should not specify clock, start or dt (see
    Technical notes below).
    
    Arbitrary slicing of the array is supported, but the clock will only
    be preserved where the intervals can be guaranteed to be fixed, that
    is except for the case where lists or numpy arrays are used on the
    time index.

    Timed arrays can be called as if they were a function of time if the
    array times are based on a clock (but not if the array times are
    arbitrary as the look up costs would be excessive). If ``x(t)`` is called
    where ``times[i]<=t<times[i]+dt`` for some index i then ``x(t)`` will
    have the value ``x[i]``. You can also call ``x(t)`` with ``t`` a 1D array.
    If x is 1D then ``x(t)[i]=x(t[i])``, if x is 2D then ``x(t)[i]=x(t[i])[i]``.
    
    Has one method:
    
    .. method: plot(*args, **kwds)
    
        Plots the values on the y axis and times on the x axis. If the array
        is 1D then this is a single plot, if it is 2D then there will be one
        plot for each second index. 3D or greater arrays are not supported.
        The args and keywords are passed to matplotlib's plot() command. In
        the 2D case, each plot is labelled with the second index.
    
    See also :class:`TimedArraySetter`, :func:`set_group_var_by_array` and
    :class:`NeuronGroup`.
    
    **Technical notes**
    
    Note that specifying a new clock, or values of start and dt, will mean
    that if you use this :class:`TimedArray` to set the value of a
    :class:`NeuronGroup` variable, it will be updated on the schedule of this
    clock, which can (due to floating point errors) induce some timing problems.
    This rarely happens, but if an occasional inaccuracy of order dt might
    conceivably be critical for your simulation, you should use
    :class:`RegularClock` objects instead of :class:`Clock` objects.
