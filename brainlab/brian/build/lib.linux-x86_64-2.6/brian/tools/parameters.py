    """
    Dictionary that can be accessed via keys
    
    Note that attributes starting with _ won't be added to the dict but
    will instead be directly added to the object.
    
    Note that an attribdict cannot have new real attributes
    added to it unless they start with _, because they will
    be added to the dict instead. To add a real attribute,
    use object.__setattr__(obj,name,val).

class Parameters(attribdict):
    """
    A storage class for keeping track of parameters
    
    Example usage::
    
        p = Parameters(
            a = 5,
            b = 6,
            computed_parameters = '''
            c = a + b
            ''')
        print p.c
        p.a = 1
        print p.c
    
    The first ``print`` statement will give 11, the second gives 7.
    
    Details:
    
    Call as::
    
        p = Parameters(...)
    
    Where the ``...`` consists of a list of keyword / value pairs (like a ``dict``).
    Keywords must not start with the underscore ``_`` character. Any
    keyword that starts with ``computed_`` should be a string of valid Python statements
    that compute new values based on the given ones. Whenever a non-computed value is
    changed, the computed parameters are recomputed, in alphabetical order of their
    keyword names (so ``computed_a`` is computed before ``computed_b`` for example).
    Non-computed values can be accessed and set via ``p.x``, ``p.x=1`` for example, whereas
    computed values can only be accessed and not set. New parameters can be added
    after the :class:`Parameters` object is created, including new ``computed_*`` parameters. You
    can 'derive' a new parameters object from a given one as follows::
    
        p1 = Parameters(x=1)
        p2 = Parameters(y=2,**p1)
        print p2.x
    
    Note that changing the value of ``x`` in ``p2`` will not change the value of ``x`` in ``p1`` (this
    is a copy operation).
