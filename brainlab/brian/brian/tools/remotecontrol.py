'''
Remote control of a Brian process, for example using an IPython shell

The process running the simulation calls something like:

server = RemoteControlServer()

and the IPython shell calls:

client = RemoteControlClient()

The shell can now execute and evaluate in the server process via:

spikes = client.evaluate('M.spikes')
i, t = zip(*spikes)
plot(t, i, '.')
client.execute('stop()')

    Initialisation arguments:
    
    ``server``
        The IP server details, a pair (host, port). If you want to allow control
        only on the one machine (for example, by an IPython shell), leave this
        as ``None`` (which defaults to host='localhost', port=2719). To allow
        remote control, use ('', portnumber).
    ``authkey``
        The authentication key to allow access, change it from 'brian' if you
        are allowing access from outside (otherwise you allow others to run
        arbitrary code on your machine).
    ``clock``
        The clock specifying how often to poll for incoming commands.
    ``global_ns``, ``local_ns``, ``level``
        Namespaces in which incoming commands will be executed or evaluated,
        if you leave them blank it will be the local and global namespace of
        the frame from which this function was called (if level=1, or from
        a higher level if you specify a different level here).
    
    Once this object has been created, use a :class:`RemoteControlClient` to
    issue commands.

    Use a :class:`RemoteControlServer` on the simulation you want to control.
    
    Has the following methods:
    
    .. method:: execute(code)
    
        Executes the specified code in the server process.
        If it raises an
        exception, the server process will catch it and reraise it in the
        client process.
        
    .. method:: evaluate(code)
    
        Evaluate the code in the server process and return the result.

        exception, the server process will catch it and reraise it in the
        client process.

        Temporarily stop the simulation in the server process, continue
        simulation with the :meth:'go' method.
        
    .. method:: go()
    
        Continue a simulation that was paused.
