         C code where defined. Requires a compatible C++ compiler.
         The ``gcc`` and ``g++`` compilers are probably the easiest
         option (use Cygwin on Windows machines). See also the
         ``weavecompiler`` global preference.

         4.2+ we recommend using ``-march=native``. By default, the ``-ffast-math``
         optimisations are turned on - if you need IEEE guaranteed results, turn
         this switch off.
