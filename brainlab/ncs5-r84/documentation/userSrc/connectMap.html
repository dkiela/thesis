    <H2>Connect Maps in NCS</H2>

    <IMG src="images/connect.png" align=right>

    After synaptic connections have been made, NCS can output a data file
    containing a map of connections between two cell clusters in the simulation.<BR>
    
    This file will be named:<B>
    job name#source column.source layer.source cellgroup.source compartment#to#destination column.destination layer.destination cellgroup.destination compartment#synapse name.connectmap.txt,</B><BR>
    where "job" is the name given in the JOB field of the Brain Block.
    
    <H3>File Format</H3>
        
    The file will only have cell indices of cells that are connected. The file is sorted in ascending order of source cell indices.<BR>
    Source cell index &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Destination cell index<BR>
    
    <H3>Internal NCS Connection Matrix Representation</H3>
    
    <P>Internally, the connections are laid out in a matrix format.  The columns correspond to
    source cells while the rows correspond to the destination cells.  Entries will either
    be a zero (0) or a one (1), where zero represents no connection between the cells while
    a one represents a connection.  Note: The source and destination clusters may represent
    the same cluster.  If that is the case, a single cell will not be allowed to connect to
    itself.
    </P>
