LISA is the supercomputer run by SARA. See sara.nl. These instructions are for using the software on LISA.

See the document BRAINLAB + NCS INSTALL for installing Brainlab and NCS.

What is different, is that LISA does not use mpich, but openmpi. To compile NCS, make sure to do:

module load openmpi
module load c

before compiling. When running NCS, make sure to execute:

module load openmpi

To get Brainlab to work, DO NOT run `module load python`, that standard python install is already good enough.
However, you do need to install brian, and sympy in ${HOME}/pythonpackages by setting the correct parameters
(through commandline) on setup.py and symlinking to these directories from the brainlab directory when the
PYTHONPATH is not working properly.

Create a jobscript for the simulation, setting the right PBS values, and execute using qsub.

Note that NCS does not work properly on LISA. You need to severely tweak
the Makefile, and even then it only works if the number of "clusters"
(i.e., layers or similar) is equal to the amount of process nodes that you
will use.
